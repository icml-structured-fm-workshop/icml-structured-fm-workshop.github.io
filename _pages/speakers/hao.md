**[Hao Wang](http://www.wanghao.in/)** is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, where I direct a Machine Learning Lab. Previously I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Dina Katabi and Prof. Tommi Jaakkola. He obtained Ph.D degree in CSE department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. His research interest focuses on statistical machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs). Currently, he mainly work on Bayesian deep learning, probabilistic methods, game-theoretic approaches, and their applications in trustworthy & safe AI (interpretability, robustness, alignment, etc.), healthcare, recommender systems, computer vision (including multimodal LLMs), natural language processing (including LLMs), network analysis, and data mining. He is also a Microsoft Fellow and received the Baidu Research Fellowship.
